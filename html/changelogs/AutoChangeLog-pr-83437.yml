changes:
  - balance: "The various mining related suits now have consistent suit storage. Try putting a knife into your explorer suit's suit storage today!"
  - balance: "Bone armor work similarly to explorer suits, with similar armor values and options to upgrade their parts. However, they use bone talismans instead of goliath hides to upgrade. Magic? Just believing really strongly that the drake is hitting you slightly less hard because of the talismans? You be the judge."
  - balance: "Goliath cloaks come fully upgraded. However..."
  - balance: "The recipes for bone armor and goliath cloaks are slightly different. Particularly goliath cloaks, which need a lot more dead goliaths to make. Sorry."
  - balance: "Mining MODsuits achieve at maximum ash accretion the same amount of melee armor as an upgraded explorer suit."
  - balance: "These various suits also consistently have wound armor."
  - bugfix: "Berserker armor properly hides underclothing and hair."
  - balance: "Berserker armor pieces can absorb drake armor to gain their enhanced protection. Become the warrior of Khorne you've always wanted to be."
  - balance: "Berserker rage now halves brute damage rather than just adding Melee Armor to you and your squishy body."
  - qol: "Berserker and H.E.C.K. helmets can be used for internals."
